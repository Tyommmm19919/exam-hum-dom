&nbsp;<span class="arr" id="arr1">&#10132;</span>About a thousand years ago, small bands of people living in the present-day American Southwest did something no one in that region had ever done before. They converged on a 12-mile-long (15 km) canyon in the desert and built a massive complex of permanent settlements with irrigation. Lasting only a few hundred years, Chaco was the largest of these communities. Others were scattered across the Colorado Plateau. Interestingly, reasons behind the emergence and eventual abandonment of Chaco remain unclear to this day.
<br><br>
&nbsp;<span class="arr" id="arr2">&#10132;</span>At its height, Chaco housed an estimated 15,000 people in eight towns and between 200- 350 small villages. A series of roads connected Chaco to dozens of other villages and centers outside the canyon. The largest towns were called "great houses." On average, they covered three acres (1.2 ha) and consisted of planned four-story complexes with up to 800 rooms as well as plazas and protective walls. Building these massive structures took many years and required wood supplied from distant forests. All of this was done without the use of the wheel or animal power. Why, after such a seemingly monumental undertaking, would the Chacoans abandon their settlements?
<br><br>
&nbsp;<span class="arr" id="arr3">&#10132;</span>One theory posits that Chaco began when Mexican merchants arrived in the region seeking the precious stone, turquoise. [BOX] If that was the case, then the continued existence of the network of towns and roads could be tied to this <span id="external">external</span> trade in luxury goods. Copper bells and macaw feathers found at Chaco offer convincing evidence of some form of trade with Mexico. [BOX] Some scholars point to certain Mexican-style architectural features, such as colonnades and rubble core walls, as evidence that some Mexicans resided at Chaco. <span id="sentence1">The fact that the Chacoans did not adopt other, more common Mexican architectural elements and Mexican pottery styles, however, does not support that conclusion.</span> [BOX] Evidence suggests that Mexican merchants moved into other turquoise-producing sites as Chaco was in decline, perhaps hastening its abandonment.[BOX]
<br><br>
&nbsp;<span class="arr" id="arr4">&#10132;</span>Other scholars argue that the trade theory puts too much weight on external influences. It is far from clear that the turquoise trade was so central to the Chaco economy that its disruption would lead to collapse. This second group says that the control of irrigation and of the redistribution of water offer more convincing explanations for Chaco's rise and fall. They note how irrigation has generally been a principal force in the rise of other ancient civilizations. Scholars observe that the towns were built alongside canyons where streams from summer rains entered the main canyon and provided water for farming. According to this theory, as villages and farming plots spread outward, the Chacoans built irrigation systems to channel water to them. Subsequently, a ruling elite emerged who controlled the distribution of this water. If correct, this would suggest that the relative equality of the early settlers shifted to a hierarchy in which leaders in the main towns ruled over the outer villages. In this case, the towns with the best land and water would have the most food. In times of need, they could share their extra food with friendly villages. This theory would suggest the highest ranking leader or chief lived in the largest town complex. However, the lack of burials at that complex hints that it was occupied by a small number of permanent residents. In addition, there are neither special rooms nor <span id="extravagant">extravagant</span> burial offerings to indicate the presence of a chief or other permanent leadership figures.
<br><br>
&nbsp;<span class="arr" id="arr5">&#10132;</span>The general absence of burials in the canyon has led to a third theory, that the great houses were actually ceremonial centers. Proponents argue that they were built as gathering places for peoples throughout the region. In this view, a small group of permanent residents maintained the centers and storehouses of extra food. Settlers from surrounding villages would travel to the great house on special occasions for ceremonies, after which <span id="they1">they</span> would return home. Trade and other forms of exchange would have also been conducted at this time. Support for this theory comes from practices of modern Pueblo people, believed to be the descendants of the Chacoans, some of whom maintain ceremonial centers where <span id="dispersed">dispersed</span> families meet during important ceremonies.
<br><br>
&nbsp;<span class="arr" id="arr6">&#10132;</span>The various investigations into the rise and decline of the Chacoans offer clues as to what life may have been like in this canyon some thousand years ago. However, no single approach presents a completely convincing explanation of why the Chacoans abandoned such monumental structures.
