        In many organizations, perhaps the best way to approach certain new projects is to assemble a group of people into a team. Having a team of people attack a project offers several advantages.<br>
<br>
First of all, a group of people has a wider range of knowledge, expertise, and skills than any single individual is likely to possess. Also, because of the nimbers of people involved and the greater resources they possess, a group can work more quickly in response to the task assigned to it and can come up with highly creative solutions to problems and issues. Sometimes these creative solutions come about because a group is more likely to make risky decisions that an individual might not undertake. This is because the group spreads responsibility for a decision to all the members and thus no single individual can be held accountable if the decision turns out to be wrong.<br>
<br>
Taking part in a group process can be very rewarding for members of the team. Team members who have a voice in making a decision will no doubt feel better about carrying out the work that is entailed by the decision than they might doing work that is imposed on them by others.<br>
<br>
Also, the individual team member has a much better chance to “shine”, to get his or her contributions and ideas not only recognized but recognized as highly significant, because a team’s overall results can be more far-reaching and have greater impact than what might have otherwise been possible for the person to accomplish or contribute working alone.<br>

Doctor: As teachers play an invaluable role in shaping young minds and preparing
students for the future, there is an ongoing discussion regarding their compensation.
Some argue that teachers should be paid salaries comparable to other high-earning
professionals like doctors, lawyers, and business executives. Do you agree or disagree
that teachers deserve salaries on par with these professions? Please explain your
viewpoint.
<br><br>
Kelly: Teachers should receive salaries on par with other high-earning professionals. They
work long hours preparing lessons, grading assignments, and supporting students.
Without good teachers, we wouldn't have doctors, lawyers, and executives. If we want to
attract the best talent to this invaluable profession, we must compensate teachers
accordingly. My favorite teachers inspired me and contributed greatly to my success.
<br><br>
Paul: I don't think teachers deserve the same high salaries as doctors or lawyers.
Teachers get so much time off, with summer vacations and other long breaks. My aunt is a
teacher and she's always posting on Facebook about trips she takes or sleeping in during
vacations. With all that time off, teachers shouldn't earn salaries on par with year-round
demanding professions.
