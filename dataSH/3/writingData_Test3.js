        The myth of Theseus describes an ancient high civilization on
the island of Crete, which ruled over mainland Greece. The
Cretans required the Greeks to send young men and women in
tribute. They were placed in a giant maze called the labyrinth
and had to face the Minotaur, a monster with the body of a
giant and the head of a bull. The myth caused historians to
wonder if a powerful Cretan kingdom had existed at one time,
but until 1900 there was no proof of any kind. In that year,
Arthur Evans, a museum director at Oxford, discovered the
remains of a great palace at Knossos in Crete. The palace was
very grand and complex, and had been built with sophisticated
techniques. To Evans, its maze-like complexity brought to mind
images of the mythical labyrinth.<br><br>
Evans also discovered many works of art, including paintings
and sculptures. One of the most famous of these paintings
shows a young man somersaulting over the back of a charging
bull. There were similar images of bulls among the other art
works as well, indicating that bulls were very important to the
Cretans. This fact, along with the labyrinthine quality of the
palace at Knossos, led Evans to conclude that the story of
Theseus, though expressed as mythology, was derived from
historical facts. Evans did not think there had been an actual
Minotaur, but it was clear to him that the Cretans had been
culturally and militarily superior to the mainland Greeks, and
therefore ruled over them. Moreover, Evans believed that Cretan
culture was the basis of the later, more well known accomplishments
of the Greeks, from philosophy to literature to architecture.
