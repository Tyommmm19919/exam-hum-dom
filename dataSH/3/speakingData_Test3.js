          <p>
           The university has decided that in order to count toward the graduation requirement,
internships must at least pay the locally relevant minimum wage. While the university
recognizes that internships provide students with valuable work experiences, we also
believe the companies providing the internships reap significant benefits from our students,
work for which the firms would otherwise have to render significant financial remuneration.
We believe we are doing our students a disservice by requiring they provide their quality
services for free over a span of six to ten weeks. This change will go into effect with the
upcoming summer semester.

          <h1 style="text-align:center;">Water Quality</h1>
          <p>
            Water quality is usually assessed by measuring the presence of specific chemicals dissolved
in the water. At certain levels, such chemicals, whether natural or introduced through
industrial processes or other human activities, may pose a health danger, or they may
change the ways water interacts with its environment. Water supplies for use by humans
are commonly described as "hard" or "soft." If a water supply has significant amounts
of dissolved calcium and magnesium, it is called hard water. By contrast, soft water has
lower quantities of these elements, although there is no particular level at which water
crosses from the soft to hard designation.
