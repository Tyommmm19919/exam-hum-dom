&nbsp;<span class="arr" id="arr1">&#10132;</span>Any map of the world displays the complementarity of the Atlantic coastlines of South America and Africa. The two continents appear to fit together like pieces of a jigsaw puzzle. This observation, first noted three centuries ago, gave rise to Alfred Wegener's early 20th-century theory of continental drift. According to Wegener's hypothesis, Africa and South America had once been part of a single land mass that later separated. However, many highly esteemed scientists were skeptical, believing it physically impossible for two continents to shift so far apart.
<br><br>
&nbsp;<span class="arr" id="arr2">&#10132;</span>Then, in the 1960s, the theory of plate tectonics arose in the scientific community. In formulating this theory, geologists developed hypotheses that answered several different questions: Why do volcanoes and earthquakes occur where they do? How did the topography of the sea floor take shape? What explains the distribution of fossil forms and glacial debris around the globe? The theory of plate tectonics offers explanations for these phenomena, and also gives <span id="cred">credence</span> to the concept of continental drift. In a few short years, plate tectonics revolutionized Earth Sciences.
<br><br>
&nbsp;<span class="arr" id="arr3">&#10132;</span>Essentially, plate tectonics addresses the movements and changes of the Earth's crust. The planet is composed of three main layers. Surrounding the large, iron-rich core of the Earth is a thick layer called the mantle. On top of the mantle lies a thin crust. The crust, or lithosphere, is rigid and varies in thickness from about 30 miles (50 kilometers) underneath the ocean to as much as 60 miles (100 kilometers) below the continents. <span id="thisBroken">This</span> is broken up into a series of rigid plates. These lithospheric plates lie on the asthenosphere, the upper part of the mantle, which has an average depth of 300 miles (500 kilometers). [BOX] Unlike the rigid lithosphere, the asthenosphere is a relatively soft, partly molten layer. [BOX] The movement of the plates, at an annual rate of two to three centimeters-about one inch-is responsible for volcanic activity and earthquakes. Modern volcanoes and earthquake epicenters lie along distinct belts. [BOX] For instance, they are ċlustered along the western coasts of the Americas, running from the southern tip of South America all the way north to Alaska. These patterns of earthquake and volcano distribution mark the edges of the lithospheric plates, where the crust has broken and the resulting plates knock and scrape against one another. Earthquakes are the surface manifestations of these huge collisio[BOX]
<br><br>
&nbsp;<span class="arr" id="arr4">&#10132;</span>The layout of the sea floor is a result of oceanic plates spreading apart and molten rock from the asthenosphere rising up to fill the chasm. <span id="quirk">Quirks</span> in fossil records can best be explained using plate tectonics. The unusual distribution pattern of the distinctive fossil plant Glossopteris, found in southern Africa, South America, Australia, India, and Antarctica, is one example of such a quirk. <span id="sentence1">It is unlikely that this precise plant could have developed in the same way at the same time on discrete continents, or that its seeds could have been carried by wind or water across the enormous oceans that separate these locales today.</span> Similarly, plate tectonics explains the pattern of glacial deposits in such diverse areas as southern India, southern Africa, the eastern coast of southern South America, the southern coast of Australia, and Antarctica. Resolving these latter two issues returns us to the idea of continental drift.
<br><br>
&nbsp;<span class="arr" id="arr5">&#10132;</span>Scientists currently believe that around 200 million years ago, there existed one huge supercontinent. Called Pangaea, meaning "all lands" in Greek, this supercontinent broke up into two smaller landmasses, which would later <span id="fragment">fragment</span> into the continents that exist today. Laurasia included what would become the northern continents of North America, Europe, and Asia. Gondwanaland comprised the southern continents of Africa, Australia, South America, Antarctica, and subcontinental India. A few objectors, mostly from religious groups, point out that the actual mechanisms for plate movement have not been conclusively expounded. Nonetheless, there is little doubt among geologists that the plates did-and still do-move. With evidence for plate tectonics being found in so many diverse disciplines-biology, chemistry, physics, geography, and mathematics, as well as geology-serious doubts about its basic principles have evaporated.

                `
&nbsp;<span class="arr" id="arr12">&#10132;</span>The discipline of economics studies how people and societies manage scarce resources. Economists consider the production, distribution, and consumption of those resources, including money, property, and labor, and they investigate related issues such as taxation and trade. The field is typically broken down into two branches, macroeconomics and microeconomics. Both branches have direct relevance to commercial entities, and both must be taken into account in determining government policies for dealing with resource problems in the real world.
<br><br>
&nbsp;<span class="arr" id="arr22">&#10132;</span>Macroeconomics looks at the big picture. It focuses on a national economy, both on the economy as a whole, and on its major <span id="components">components</span>. Rather than examining the details of an individual's or group's economic activity, it takes a broader view, using "macro variables" like employment levels, savings rates, and national debt. This approach searches for the factors that affect those variables and detects the relationships between them, asking questions, for instance, about the inflation rate and how it affects the total amount of goods and services consumers are buying. In other words, it focuses on large systems rather than on a few nodes within <span id="them2">them</span>.
<br><br>
&nbsp;<span class="arr" id="arr32">&#10132;</span>Microeconomics, on the other hand, takes a more in-depth approach to what is happening in an economy. Instead of looking at total figures, such as national income, it focuses on the basic components of the economy, for instance, family incomes. It asks how many cars a company sold in a given quarter, or looks at the <span id="going">going</span> rate for plumbers. Microeconomics also poses questions about pricing of items, how items are marketed, and mortgage interest rates. Even though it deals with such specific questions, microeconomics also concerns itself with associated larger phenomena, such as causes and effects. The effects of a hurricane on the oil markets, for example, fall in the area of microeconomics, despite the large forces involved.                
<br><br>        
&nbsp;<span class="arr" id="arr42">&#10132;</span>Both micro- and macroeconomic value-laden discussions about analyses can generate which policy choices would be best for a particular economy. This suggests another useful framework for looking at economics: as either positive or normative. The positive approach does not make an attempt to assess the value-in terms of fairness, for instance-of a policy. [BOX] Its concern is not the world as it should be, but the world as it is. It studies the results of changes in the economic order and the effects of policies, but it does not make any judgment about whether such changes or effects are good or bad, fair or unfair. It simply seeks to explain what has happened. [BOX] For its part, the normative approach does make value judgments. [BOX] It applies norms, or standards, as it looks at a policy or an economic condition and, weighing the policy's impact, decides whether or not the result is desirable. [BOX]
<br><br>
&nbsp;<span class="arr" id="arr52">&#10132;</span><span id="sentence2">Although the discussion of economics up to this point has referred to familiar and traditional economic concepts, studying economics is hardly limited to the commercial domain of human life.</span> Economists today study a much wider range of human activity and apply economic theories to a variety of areas.
<br><br>
&nbsp;<span class="arr" id="arr62">&#10132;</span>Basic assumptions about choices made by consumers in the marketplace also hold true for voters in an election. Crime and pollution can also be analyzed according to economic principles, as can aspects of human behavior like how people choose to spend their time or why they like a certain movie. The common element here is the attempt to acquire or manage scarce resources. Time is famously in short supply. Pollution destroys resources that belong to many, so that a few can prosper. The techniques of economics apply a certain systematic analysis to scarcity issues that might otherwise be handled with mere <span id="assertions">assertions</span> of opinion.

            text: [
                `
&nbsp;<span class="arr" id="arr13">&#10132;</span>Early Chinese thinkers believed pictures or images were mysterious items that allowed viewers to access a sort of truth that was not normally accessible. When a person or thing was seen through a picture, hidden underlying qualities were revealed. The Chinese considered the landscape to epitomize this principle. The landscape contained the essence of the world of nature, in which natural features were held to have a kind of integral quality that could not be rendered in simple words and, as such, occupied a more subtle or profound position than humans. The landscape was thought to show how seemingly <span id="mundane">mundane</span> natural objects took on a transcendent character when properly viewed and considered.
<br><br>
&nbsp;<span class="arr" id="arr23">&#10132;</span>[BOX] The first formal description of proper standards for painting was an essay by Xie He, written in the mid-sixth century, in which he defined the six aspects of correct painting and how these aspects were to be applied. [BOX] Partly because of Xie's formalized set of rules, landscape painting in China developed greatly during the Tang Dynasty (618-907). During this time, it became the primary subject for the social class including scholars and government officials, who studied both artistic appreciation and actual painting. [BOX] For this group, the landscape became a way to present the innate, true qualities of nature. [BOX]
<br><br>
&nbsp;<span class="arr" id="arr33">&#10132;</span>This theory of the correct role for painting was stated in the tenth century by Ching Hao, in his "Essay on Landscape Painting." Drawing on Xie He's principles, Ching <span id="formulated">formulated</span> a system with six essential characteristics of painting, which distinguished between resemblance, meaning accurate representation of an object's surface qualities, and truth, meaning an object's inner essence. There was a difference between what something appeared to be and what it really was. Truth was not <span id="evident">evident</span>, but hidden in some way, and the proper goal of painting was to represent a balance between outer form and inner truth. The artist must be aware of what is true and be able to express it within natural forms.
<br><br>
&nbsp;<span class="arr" id="arr43">&#10132;</span>It is possible to see this balance in a well-executed landscape. <span id="sentence3">The images are realistic but do not look exactly like their actual counterparts in nature because the artist tries to bring out all the elements or constituents of an object simultaneously.</span> A tree will be painted so that all of its parts, whether roots, trunk, or branches, are balanced and clearly visible with no one part standing out more than any other. There may also be some indication that the tree is changing, such as budding or losing its leaves, which show that the tree is alive. Like the trees, mountains will display a common set of characteristics that Chinese artists identified as being representative of and integral to any mountain real or imaginary, wherever it might be. From slopes and stones at all angles to falling water, from the various hues of rock to both beautiful and remote qualities in the same image, these features always appear. People, buildings, and animals are also present but always very small, showing that they are contained by nature, not apart from it or controlling it. Thus humans are shown in their proper place as part of the natural order, which according to classical Chinese thought, is the source of virtue and morality.
<br><br>
&nbsp;<span class="arr" id="arr53">&#10132;</span>Further, the composition itself enhances the idea of nature as something in development, flowing and changing, which cannot be comprehended at once. The features of the painting cannot be viewed all at the same time, as in a panorama. Instead, <span id="it3">it</span> calls viewers to examine each part in detail, separate from the rest, but still retaining a connection to the whole. This evokes a sense of time in the landscape, in the same sense as a person gets while walking somewhere in the mountains. Everything cannot be seen at once, but details are revealed one after the other, which remain parts of the whole structure as contained in the mind. In this way, the landscape is more a representation of a conscious experience than a simple static scene. The most significant result is that the viewer should feel refreshed and comforted, with worldly cares and frustrations suspended and moral sense renewed. Guo Xi, one of the most famous of the eleventh century landscapists, summed up this idea nicely when he wrote, "The virtuous man above all delights in landscapes."

                `
&nbsp;<span class="arr" id="arr14">&#10132;</span>Benjamin Franklin (1706-790), one of the most <span id="ven">venerated</span> of the US founding fathers, was a famous statesman, successful businessman, avid philosopher, and prolific inventor. His greatest legacy, however, might not be the key role he played at the 1787 US Constitutional Convention. It also might not be the printing shop he founded, or any of his inventions, which include bifocals, the Franklin stove, the odometer, daylight savings time, and the lightning rod. Instead, Franklin, whom Scottish philosopher David Hume called "America's first great man of letters," arguably made his most profound mark on the world as a writer. Franklin's literary contributions have often been overlooked in light of later US greats such as Mark Twain, Ernest Hemingway, and F. Scott Fitzgerald. Like Hemingway, Franklin was a newspaper reporter before he moved on to publish essays, journals, and books. The most famous of his publications include Autobiography, Way to Wealth, and Poor Richard's Almanack, an annual publication that he founded in 1732 and authored until 1748.
<br><br>
&nbsp;<span class="arr" id="arr24">&#10132;</span>As his writing came upon the heels of 17th-century Puritan literature in America, a distinct contrast can be noted between Franklin and his predecessors. Notable among the many disjunctions, the autobiographies of influential Puritan writers differ sharply with Franklin's Autobiography in their credit of sources of material and moral accomplishments. The Puritans credited God's grace for their successes, while Franklin credited personal effort and perseverance for <span id="his4">his</span>. Additionally, Puritan writers used a preachy, sermon-like style that stressed the importance of religious faith with an eye toward life after death. Franklin, on the other hand, grounded his observations in the here-and-now, using an engaging prose style to explain his philosophy of the importance of developing character through life experiences.
<br><br>
&nbsp;<span class="arr" id="arr34">&#10132;</span>Franklin's first published essays appeared in 1722 in the New England Courant, a newspaper published by his brother, James. Benjamin's writing style at this time was modeled principally upon that of The Spectator, a British paper edited by Joseph Addison and Richard Steele. Early on, though, Franklin displayed an ability to write concise, clear news stories. In 1729, he became publisher and editor of The Pennsylvania Gazette, which he developed into a newspaper highly praised as the best in the American colonies.
<br><br>
&nbsp;<span class="arr" id="arr44">&#10132;</span>Franklin's primary contribution to American literature can be traced to his preference for sharing his opinion about popular topics rather than simply reporting on current events. This editorial approach to a story is much in the same vein as some modern newspaper columns.<span id="sentence4"> Through his writings, Franklin helped develop America's national identity, shifting American consciousness from a spiritual Puritanism to a secular rationalism characteristic of 18"-century enlightenment, thus creating a dawning awareness that America was a country with distinctly different values and interests from those of England.</span> Poor Richard's Almanack and Autobiography, for example, are written in the style of self-help guides. They are packed with enlightening maxims such as "an investment in knowledge pays the best interest," "time is money," and "hear reason, or she'll make you feel her." Franklin imbued his journalism with a similar <span id="did">didactic</span> tone. One article entitled "Death of a Drunk," gave Franklin an opportunity to pass on a moral lesson about the dangers of drinking. Author Robert Arner stated that Franklin's writings "demonstrate a deep and abiding belief in the power of the press to educate the public on topical issues." Franklin's news sense for unusual and interesting stories also set a tone that echoes even in today's newspapers. The Gazette specialized in brief, offbeat articles about people, such as a husband who tried to decapitate his wife's lover, or a fiddler who saved his fiddle, but not his wife, after the canoe they were in capsized. Although some criticized this as sensationalism, Franklin's venerable wisdom and natural wit tinted the short reports and attracted a huge and loyal audience.
<br><br>
&nbsp;<span class="arr" id="arr54">&#10132;</span>Another significant effect on early American literature made by Franklin was his unique writing style. It was reflected in a philosophy he expressed in a 1732 essay: good writing should be "smooth, clear, and short." [BOX] Compared especially with that of other 18th-century authors, Franklin's writing is concise and readable. [BOX] That contrast holds true not only among his contemporaries but also among writers in subsequent ages. [BOX] Franklin played a leading role in developing journalism as a <span id="terse">terse</span> writing form, getting quickly to the point and dwelling on important instead of secondary facts. Moreover, Franklin was a word economist, finding the shortest way to express a thought, as demonstrated by his frequent use of aphorisms. [BOX] These sayings remain popular today not so much because of their moral wisdom but because of their brevity. Expressions such as "well done is better than well said," and "when in doubt, don't" dispense moral certitude in sentences that are catchy and easy to remember -a timeless writing tip.
