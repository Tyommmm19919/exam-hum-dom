            title: "The Roman Army's Impact on Britain",
            text: [
                `
&nbsp;<span class="arr" id="arr1">&#10132;</span>In the wake of the Roman Empire's conquest of Britain in the first century A.D., a large number of troops stayed in the new province, and these troops had a considerable impact on Britain with their camps, fortifications, and participation in the local economy. Assessing the impact of the army on the civilian population starts from the realization that the soldiers were always unevenly distributed across the country. Areas rapidly incorporated into the empire were not long affected by the military. Where the army remained stationed, its presence was much more influential. The imposition of a military base involved the requisition of native lands for both the fort and the territory needed to feed and exercise the soldiers' animals. The imposition of military rule also robbed local leaders of opportunities to participate in local government, so social development was stunted and the seeds of disaffection sown. This then meant that the military had to remain to suppress rebellion and organize government.
<br><br>
&nbsp;<span class="arr" id="arr2">&#10132;</span>Economic exchange was clearly very important as the Roman army brought with it very substantial spending power. Locally a fort had two kinds of impact. Its large population needed food and other supplies.[BOX] Some of these were certainly brought from long distances, but demands were inevitably placed on the local area.[BOX] Although goods could be requisitioned, they were usually paid for, and this probably stimulated changes in the local economy.[BOX] When not campaigning, soldiers needed to be occupied; otherwise they represented a potentially dangerous source of <span id="friction">friction</span> and disloyalty.[BOX] Hence a writing tablet dated 25 April tells of <span id="men343">343 men at one fort engaged on tasks like shoemaking, building a bathhouse, operating kilns, digging clay, and working lead</span>. Such activities had a major effect on the local area, in particular with the construction of infrastructure such as roads, which improved access to remote areas.
<br><br>
&nbsp;<span class="arr" id="arr3">&#10132;</span>Each soldier received his pay, but in regions without a developed economy there was initially little on which it could be spent. The pool of excess cash rapidly stimulated a thriving economy outside fort gates. Some of the demand for the services and goods was no doubt fulfilled by people drawn from far afield, but some local people certainly became entwined in this new economy. There was informal marriage with soldiers, who until AD 197 were not legally entitled to wed, and whole new communities grew up near the forts. These settlements acted like small towns, becoming centers for the artisan and trading populations.
<br><br>
&nbsp;<span class="arr" id="arr4">&#10132;</span>The army also provided a mean of personal advancement for auxiliary soldiers recruited from the native peoples, as a man obtained hereditary Roman citizenship on retirement after service in an auxiliary regiment. Such units recruited on an ad hoc (as needed) basis from the area in which they were stationed, and there was evidently large-scale recruitment within Britain. The total numbers were at least 12,500 men up to the reign of the emperor Hadrian (A.D. 117-138), with a peak around A.D. 80. Although a small proportion of the total population, this perhaps had a massive local impact when a large proportion of the young men were removed from an area. Newly raised regiments were normally transferred to another province from whence it was unlikely that individual recruits would ever return. Most units raised in Britain went elsewhere on the European continent, although one is recorded in Morocco. The reverse process brought young men to Britain, where many continued to live after their 20 to 25 years of service, and this added to the cosmopolitan Roman character of the frontier population. By the later Roman period, frontier garrisons (groups of soldiers) were only rarely transferred, service in units became effectively hereditary, and forts were no longer populated or maintained at full strength.
<br><br>
&nbsp;<span class="arr" id="arr5">&#10132;</span>This process of settling in as a community over several generations, combined with local recruitment, presumably accounts for the apparent stability of the British northern frontier in the later Roman period. It also explains why <span id="some">some of the forts continued in occupation long after Rome ceased to have any formal authority in Britain</span>, at the beginning of the fifth century A.D. The circumstances that had allowed natives to become Romanized also led the self-sustaining military community of the frontier area to become effectively British.

            title: "Succession Climax and Ecosystems",
            text: [
                `
&nbsp;<span class="arr" id="arr12">&#10132;</span>In the late nineteenth century, ecology began to grow into an independent science from its roots in natural history and plant geography. The emphasis of this new "community ecology" was on the composition and structure of communities consisting of different species. In the early twentieth century, the American ecologist Frederic Clements pointed out that a succession of plant communities would develop after a disturbance such as a volcanic eruption, heavy flood, or forest fire. An abandoned field, for instance, will be invaded successively by herbaceous plants (plants with little or no woody tissue), shrubs, and trees, eventually becoming a forest. Light-loving species are always among the first invaders, while shade-tolerant species appear later in the succession.
<br><br>
&nbsp;<span class="arr" id="arr22">&#10132;</span>Clements and other early ecologists saw almost lawlike regularity in the order of succession, but that has not been <span id="substained">substantiated</span>. A general trend can be recognized, but the details are usually unpredictable. Succession is influenced by many factors: the nature of the soil, exposure to sun and wind, regularity of precipitation, chance colonizations, and many other random processes.
<br><br>
&nbsp;<span class="arr" id="arr32">&#10132;</span>The final stage of a succession, called the climax by Clements and early ecologists, is <span id="likewise">likewise</span> not predictable or of uniform composition. There is usually a good deal of turnover in species composition, even in a mature community. The nature of the climax is influenced by the same factors that influenced succession. Nevertheless, mature natural environments are usually in equilibrium. They change relatively little through time unless the environment itself changes.
<br><br>
&nbsp;<span class="arr" id="arr42">&#10132;</span>For Clements, the climax was a "superorganism," an organic entity. Even some authors who accepted the climax concept rejected Clements' characterization of it as a superorganism, and it is indeed a misleading metaphor. An ant colony may be <span id="legit">legitimately</span> called a superorganism because its communication system is so highly organized that the colony always works as a whole and appropriately according to the circumstances. But there is no evidence for such an interacting communicative network in a climax plant formation. Many authors prefer the term "association" to the term "community" in order to stress the looseness of the interaction.
<br><br>
&nbsp;<span class="arr" id="arr52">&#10132;</span>Even less fortunate was the extension of this type of thinking to include animals as well as plants. This resulted in the <span id="biome">"biome,"</span> a combination of coexisting flora and fauna. Though it is true that many animals are strictly associated with certain plants, it is misleading to speak of a "spruce-moose biome," for example, because there is no internal cohesion to their association as in an organism. The spruce community is not substantially affected by either the presence or absence of moose. <span id="indeed">Indeed, there are vast areas of spruce forest without moose.</span> The opposition to the Clementsian concept of plant ecology was initiated by Herbert Gleason, soon joined by various other ecologists. Their major point was that the distribution of a given species was controlled by the habitat requirements of that species and that therefore the vegetation types were a simple consequence of the ecologies of individual plant species.
<br><br>
&nbsp;<span class="arr" id="arr62">&#10132;</span><span id="sentence2">With "climax," "biome," "superorganism," and various other technical terms for the association of animals and plants at a given locality being criticized, the term "ecosystem" was more and more widely adopted for the whole system of associated organisms together with the physical factors of their environment.</span> Eventually, the energy-transforming role of such a system was emphasized. Ecosystems thus involve the circulation, transformation, and accumulation of energy and matter through the medium of living things and their activities. The ecologist is concerned primarily with the quantities of matter and energy that pass through a given ecosystem, and with the rates at which they do so.
<br><br>
&nbsp;<span class="arr" id="arr72">&#10132;</span>Although the ecosystem concept was very popular in the 1950s and 1960s, it is no longer the dominant paradigm.[BOX] Gleason's arguments against climax and biome are largely valid against ecosystems as well.[BOX] Furthermore, the number of interactions is so great that they are difficult to analyze, even with the help of large computers. Finally, younger ecologists have found ecological problems involving behavior and life-history adaptations more attractive than measuring physical constants.[BOX] Nevertheless, one still speaks of the ecosystem when referring to a local association of animals and plants, usually without paying much attention to the energy aspects.[BOX]
