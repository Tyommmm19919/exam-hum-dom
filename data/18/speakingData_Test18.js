          <p>
           The university administration today announced a $25 increase in the student fee for using the campus recreation center. The higher fee, which all students are required to pay, will provide funds to upgrade the facility and provide newer, more modern exercise equipment at the center. “We expect the improvements to increase student use of the facility,” explained David Smith, director of the student activities office. Mr. Smith also noted that the decision was approved because “We feel that $25 is a reasonable increase that will be affordable for individual students.”

          <h1 style="text-align:center;">Social Learning</h1>
          <p>
            One way people learn is by watching the behavior of others. Sometimes called social learning, this type of learning involves the process of learning to copy---or not coy---the action of another. By observing the results, or consequences, of another’s behavior, people tend to imitate the behavior of another when they see that it leads to a desirable consequence---hoping to repeat it for themselves. Of course, the opposite is also true---people tend to avoid imitating the behavior of another when they see it result in an undesirable consequence.
