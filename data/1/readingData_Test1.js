      title: "Groundwater",
      text: [
        `
&nbsp;<span class="arr" id="arr1">&#10132;</span> Groundwater is the word used to describe water that saturates the ground, filling all the available spaces. By far the most abundant
type of groundwater is meteoric water; this is the groundwater that circulates as part of the water cycle. Ordinary meteoric water 
is water that has soaked into the ground from the surface, from precipitation (rain and snow) and from lakes and streams. There it 
remains, sometimes for long periods, before emerging at the surface again. At first thought it seems incredible that there can be 
enough space in the "solid" ground underfoot to hold all this water.<br><br>
&nbsp;<span class="arr" id="arr2">&#10132;</span>The necessary space is there, however, in many forms. The commonest spaces are those among the particles—sand grains and tiny 
pebbles—of loose, unconsolidated sand and gravel. Beds of this material, <span id="outS">out of sight</span> beneath the soil, are common. They are found 
wherever fast rivers carrying loads of coarse sediment once flowed. For example, as the great ice sheets that covered North America 
during the last ice age steadily melted away, huge volumes of water flowed from them. The water was always laden with pebbles, gravel,
and sand, known as <span id="glacial">glacial outwash</span>, that was deposited as the flow slowed down.<br><br>
&nbsp;<span class="arr" id="arr3">&#10132;</span> The same thing happens to this day, though on a smaller scale, wherever a sediment-laden river or stream emerges from a mountain 
valley onto relatively flat land, dropping its load as the current slows: the water usually spreads out fanwise, depositing the 
sediment in the form of a smooth, fan-shaped slope. Sediments are also dropped where a river slows on entering a lake or the sea, 
the deposited sediments are on a lake floor or the seafloor at first, but will be located inland at some future date, when the sea 
level falls or the land rises; such beds are sometimes thousands of meters thick.<br><br>
&nbsp;<span class="arr" id="arr4">&#10132;</span> In lowland country almost any spot on the ground may overlie what was once the bed of a river that has since become buried by soil;
if they are now below the water's upper surface (the water table), the gravels and sands of the former riverbed, and its sandbars, 
will be saturated with groundwater.<br><br>
&nbsp;<span class="arr" id="arr5">&#10132;</span> So much for unconsolidated sediments. Consolidated (or cemented) sediments, too, contain millions of minute water-holding pores.
This is because the gaps among the original grains are often not totally <span id="plugged">plugged</span> with cementing chemicals; also, parts of the original
grains may become dissolved by percolating groundwater, either while consolidation is taking place or at any time afterwards. 
The result is that sandstone, for example, can be as porous as the loose sand from which it was formed.<br><br>
Thus a proportion of the total volume of any sediment, loose or cemented, consists of empty space. Most crystalline rocks are much 
more solid; a common exception is basalt, a form of solidified volcanic lava, which is sometimes full of tiny bubbles that make it 
very porous.<br><br>
&nbsp; <span class="arr" id="arr6">&#10132;</span>The proportion of empty space in a rock is known as its porosity. But note that porosity is not the same as permeability, which 
measures the ease with which water can flow through a material; this depends on the sizes of the individual cavities and the crevices 
linking them.<br><br>
&nbsp;<span class="arr" id="arr7">&#10132;</span><span class="arr" id="arr71">&#10132;</span>Much of the water in a sample of water-saturated sediment or rock will drain from it if the sample is put in a suitable dry place.[BOX] 
But some will remain, clinging to all solid surfaces.[BOX] It is held there by the force of surface tension without which water would 
drain instantly from any wet surface, leaving it totally dry.[BOX] The total volume of water in the saturated sample must therefore be 
thought of as consisting of water that can, and water that cannot, drain away.[BOX] <br><br>
&nbsp;<span class="arr" id="arr8">&#10132;</span> The relative amount of these two kinds of water varies greatly from one kind of rock or sediment to another, even though their
porosities may be the same. What happens depends on pore size. <span id="sentence1">If the pores are large, the water in them will exist as drops too
heavy for surface tension to hold, and it will drain away; but if the pores are small enough, the water in them will exist as thin 
films, too light to overcome the force of surface tension holding them in place; then the water will be firmly held.</span>`

      title: "The Origins of Theater",
      text: [
        `
&nbsp;<span class="arr" id="arr9">&#10132;</span> In seeking to describe the origins of theater, one must rely primarily on speculation, since there is little concrete evidence 
on which to draw. The most widely accepted theory, <span id="championed">championed</span> by anthropologists in the late nineteenth and early twentieth 
centuries, envisions theater as emerging out of myth and ritual. The process perceived by these anthropologists may be 
summarized briefly. During the early stages of its development, a society becomes aware of forces that appear to influence or 
control its food supply and well-being. Having little understanding of natural causes, it attributes both desirable and undesirable 
occurrences to supernatural or magical forces, and it searches for means to win the favor of these forces. Perceiving an apparent 
connection between certain actions performed by the group and the result it desires, the group repeats, refines and formalizes those 
actions into fixed ceremonies, or rituals. <br><br>
&nbsp;<span class="arr" id="arr10">&#10132;</span> Stories (myths) may then grow up around a ritual. Frequently the myths include representatives of those supernatural forces that 
the rites celebrate or hope to influence. Performers may wear costumes and masks to represent the mythical characters or supernatural 
forces in the rituals or in accompanying celebrations. As a person becomes more sophisticated, its conceptions of supernatural forces
and causal relationships may change. As a result, it may abandon or modify some rites. But the myths that have grown up around the 
rites may continue as part of the group's oral tradition and may even come to be acted out under conditions divorced from these 
rites. When <span id="this">this</span> occurs, the first step has been taken toward theater as an autonomous activity, and thereafter entertainment 
and aesthetic values may gradually replace the former mystical and socially efficacious concerns.<br><br>
&nbsp;<span class="arr" id="arr11">&#10132;</span> [BOX] Although origin in ritual has long been the most popular, it is by no means the only theory about how the theater came into 
being.[BOX] Storytelling has been proposed as one alternative.[BOX] Under this theory, relating and listening to stories are seen as fundamental
human pleasures.[BOX] Thus, the recalling of an event (a hunt, battle, or other feat) is elaborated through the narrator's pantomime and 
impersonation and eventually through each role being assumed by a different person.<br><br>
&nbsp;<span class="arr" id="arr12">&#10132;</span> A closely related theory sees theater as evolving out of dances that are primarily pantomimic, rhythmical or gymnastic, or from 
imitations of animal noises and sounds. Admiration for the performer's skill, virtuosity, and grace are seen as motivation for 
elaborating the activities into fully realized theatrical performances.<br><br>
&nbsp;<span class="arr" id="arr13">&#10132;</span><span class="arr" id="arr131">&#10132;</span> In addition to exploring the possible antecedents of theater, scholars have also theorized about the motives that led people to 
develop theater. Why did theater develop, and why was it valued after it ceased to fulfill the function of ritual? Most answers 
fall back on the theories about the human mind and basic human needs. One, set forth by Aristotle in the fourth century B.C., 
sees humans as naturally imitative—as taking pleasure in imitating persons, things, and actions and in seeing such imitations.
Another, advanced in the twentieth century, suggests that humans have a gift for fantasy, through which they seek to reshape 
reality into more satisfying forms than those encountered in daily life. Thus, fantasy or fiction (of which drama is one form)
permits people to objectify their anxieties and fears, confront them, and fulfill their hopes in fiction if not fact. The theater,
then, is one tool whereby people define and understand their world or escape from unpleasant realities.<br><br>
&nbsp;<span class="arr" id="arr14">&#10132;</span> But neither the human imitative instinct nor a <span id="perchant">penchant</span> for fantasy by itself leads to an autonomous theater. Therefore, additional
explanations are needed. One necessary condition seems to be a somewhat detached view of human problems. For example, one sign of
this condition is the appearance of the comic vision, since comedy requires sufficient detachment to view some deviations from 
social norms as ridiculous rather than as serious threats to the welfare of the entire group. Another condition that contributes
to the development of autonomous theater is the emergence of the aesthetic sense. <span id="sentence2">For example, some early societies ceased to 
consider certain rites essential to their well-being and abandoned them, nevertheless, they retained as parts of their oral
tradition the myths that had grown up around the rites and admired them for their artistic qualities rather than for their 
religious usefulness.</span>`
