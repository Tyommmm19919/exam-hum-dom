          <p>
          The administration has announced plans to acquire a new sculpture for campus. We should all oppose this plan. 
          The university's financial pool financial condition led it to increase the price for campus housing and tuition by 
          15% this past year. Surely then it is in no financial position to purchase such an expensive sculpture. Moreover, just 
          look at the sculpture: several 60-foot long steel plates, jutting out of the earth at odd angles. It's so large; it'll 
          take up all the green space in front of the campus center! This is public space that should be reserved for students to use.

          <h1 style="text-align:center;">Groupthink</h1>
          <p>
            One process by which groups may make bad or irrational decisions is known as groupthink. Individual members of a 
            group attempt to conform their opinions to what they believe to be the group consensus even though the result may be 
            negative. These include the desire to be like, fear of losing a job, or even not wanting to be the one employee delaying
            a decision that seems inevitable. These kinds of implicit pressures to conform lead group members to ultimately make 
            decisions that each by himself or herself, might normally not make.
