        readingPassage: `<h2>Reading Passage</h2> In the United States,employees typically work five days a week for eight hours each 
        day. However, many employees want to work a four-day week and are willing to accept less pay in order to do so. A mandatory
        policy requiring companies to offer their employees the option of working a four-day workweek for four-fifths (80 percent) 
        of their normal pay would benefit the economy as a whole as well as the individual companies and the employees who decided 
        to take the option.<br><br>
        The shortened workweek would increase company profits because employees would feel more rested and alert, and as a result, 
        they would make fewer costly errors in their work. Hiring more staff to ensure that the same amount of work would be 
        accomplished would not result in additional payroll costs because four-day employees would only be paid 80 percent of 
        the normal rate. In the end, companies would have fewer overworked and error-prone employees for the same money,which 
        would increase company profits.<br><br>
        For the country as a whole, one of the primary benefits of offering this option to employees is that it would reduce 
        unemployment rates. If many full- time employees started working fewer hours, some of their workload would have to be 
        shifted to others. Thus, for every four employees who went on an 80 percent week, a new employee could be hired at the 
        80 percent rate.<br><br>
        Finally, the option of a four- day workweek would be better for individual employees. Employees who could afford a lower 
        salary in exchange for more free time could improve the quality of their lives by spending the extra time with their families,
         pursuing private interests, or enjoying leisure activities.<br><br>`,

        question:`
Dr Achebe: This week, we'll be exploring the dynamics of entrepreneurship, particularly
focusing on whether entrepreneurs should collaborate with family members when starting
a business or if it's preferable to avoid such partnerships. Many entrepreneurs face this
dilemma due to the potential benefits of trust and shared vision with family, but also the
risks of conflicts and business complications. What are your thoughts on this? Do you
believe entrepreneurs should start a business with family members?
<br><br>
Andrew: Working together with family members can really strengthen the family bond and
shared goals. My uncle and cousins started a restaurant, and seeing them collaborate withthat level of trust and commitment is inspiring. Though conflicts may arise. If you can
resolve them, the family ties will be even stronger in the end.
<br><br>
Claire: I don't think it's a good idea for entrepreneurs to go into business with family
members. While you may have trust and share the same vision, family members tend to
think too much alike. This limits new perspectives and innovation. There's also a higher
risk of conflicts and messy situations arising between relatives that could hurt the
business.
