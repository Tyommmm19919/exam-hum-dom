In the 1950s Torreya taxifoha, a type of evergreen tree once very common in the state of Florida, started to die out. No one is sure exactly what caused the decline, but chances are good that if nothing is done, Torreya will soon become extinct. Experts are considering three ways to address the decline of Torreya.
<br><br>
The first option is to reestablish Torreya in the same location in which it thrived for thousands of years. Torreya used to be found in abundance in the northern part of Florida, which has a specific microclimate. A microclimate exists when weather conditions inside a relatively small area differ from the region of which that area is a part. Northern Florida's microclimate is very favorable to Torreya's growth. This microclimate is wetter and cooler than the surrounding region's relatively dry, warm climate. Scientists have been working to plant Torreya seeds in the coolest, dampest areas of the microclimate.
<br><br>
The second option is to move Torreya to an entirely different location, far from its Florida microclimate. Torreya seeds and saplings have been successfully planted and grown in forests further north, where the temperature is significantly cooler. Some scientists believe that Torreya probably thrived in areas much further north in the distant past, so by relocating it now, in a process known as assisted migration, humans would simply be helping Torreya return to an environment that is more suited to its survival.
<br><br>
The third option is to preserve Torreya in research centers. Seeds and saplings can be moved from the wild and preserved in a closely monitored environment where it will be easier for scientists both to protect the species and conduct research on Torreya. This research can then be used to ensure the continued survival of the species.

Doctor Achebe: Today, we're exploring the impacts of children caring for pets. Some
believe caring for animals like dogs or cats can teach kids responsibility and empathy and
improve their social skills. Can having a pet benefit children in their development? What
do you think about the idea of kids raising pets? Please share your thoughts on whether
children benefit from caring for a pet and how this experience might influence their growth
and development.

<br><br>

Andrew: I think children benefit from raising pets and fostering a sense of responsibility
and empathy. Additionally, nurturing scientific curiosity is crucial for their development.
Encouraging hands-on experiments and interactive learning in science enhances critical
thinking and problem-solving skills. By combining pet care with scientific exploration, we
can help kids develop a well-rounded set of skills.

Claire: I believe it's not beneficial for kids to raise pets, as the parents often care for them.
Children might lack the responsibility needed for proper pet care. Moreover, pets require
consistent attention, which can be challenging for kids to manage school and activities.
This situation often results in parents taking on the primary caregiving role.
