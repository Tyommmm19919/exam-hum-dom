        Communal online encyclopedias represent one of the latest resources to be found on the Internet. They are in many respects like traditional printed encyclopedias collections of articles on various subjects. What is specific to these online encyclopedias, however, is that any Internet user can contribute a new article or make an editorial change in an existing one. As a result, the encyclopedia is authored by the whole community of Internet users. The idea might sound attractive, but the communal online encyclopedias have several important problems that make them much less valuable than traditional, printed encyclopedias.<br>

First, contributors to a communal online encyclopedia often lack academic credentials, thereby making their contributions partially informed at best and downright inaccurate in many cases. Traditional encyclopedias are written by trained experts who adhere to standards of academic rigor that nonspecialists cannot really achieve.<br>

Second, even if the original entry in the online encyclopedia is correct, the communal nature of these online encyclopedias gives unscrupulous users and vandals or hackers the opportunity to fabricate, delete, and corrupt information in the encyclopedia. Once changes have been made to the original text, an unsuspecting user cannot tell the entry has been tampered with. None of this is possible with a traditional encyclopedia.<br>

Third, the communal encyclopedias focus too frequently, and in too great a depth, on trivial and popular topics, which creates a false impression of what is important and what is not. A child doing research for a school project may discover that a major historical event receives as much attention in anonline encyclopedia as, say, a single long-running television program. The traditional encyclopedia provides a considered view of what topics to include or exclude and contains a sense of proportion that online "democratic" communal encyclopedias do not.<br>

        question:`
Doctor Diaz: This week, we discussed the importance of role models and opinion-makers
in society. One idea we discussed was the widespread impact of "influencers." Influencers
are people who are very active in posting on social media and who have many followers.
Influencers' posts and opinions can influence their followers' choices on everything from
fashion to politics. In your opinion, do social media influencers generally have a positive or
negative effect on their followers? Why do you think so?
<br><br>
Kelly: I think the influencer effect is generally positive. People can learn about the latest
trends and topics in a very quick and efficient way by following influencers. In the past,
people had to spend time looking through magazines or visiting boutiques to even know
what was trending.
<br><br>
Paul: I think influencers generally have a negative effect because they have far too much
influence. I can think of one influencer who only has to mention a particular kind of sports
shoe, and the next day, they'll be sold out. The followers aren't really thinking for
themselves; they're just blindly following the influencers' choices.
