          <h1 style="text-align:center;">Remove old Bicycles from Campus Racks</h1>
          <p>
           I noticed that there are bicycles locked to the campus bicycle racks that have not been moved for a long time. I think the university should remove these bikes from the racks and dispose of them. I recommend this action because, first of all, they will not be missed by anyone, since this apparently have been forgotten by their owners. More importantly, removing the bikes would help to free up space on the racks, thereby benefiting people who are actually using their bikes and need places to park them.

          <p>
            Many animals live in environments where food is plentiful during certain times of the year and scarce during other times of the year. In such environments, some animals collect and prepare food when it is plentiful, then hoard it—store it—for future use. Some types of hoarders engage in scatter hoarding. Unlike other types of hoarders, scatter hoarders do not store the food all in one place; instead, they scatter it—divide it up and hide it in many different places. Later, at a time when food is scarce, the hoarders return to these hiding places and recover the food.
