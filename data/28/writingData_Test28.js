Large numbers of dinosaur fossils have been discovered in deposits on Alaska's North Slope, a region that today experiences an extremely cold,arctic climate. One hundred million years ago, when those dinosaurs were alive, the environment of the North Slope was already inhospitable,especially during the winter when it experienced several months of total darkness. How did the dinosaurs survive the wintertime? Paleontologists have proposed that one of the most common North Slope dinosaurs, the elephant-sized edmontosaur (Edmontosaurus), survived the winter by migrating south to more hospitable regions. Several arguments support the migration hypothesis.
<br><br>
First, the edmontosaur's diet supports the migration hypothesis.Edmontosaurs fed exclusively on plants. Since there would have been no plants growing during the cold and dark North Slope winter, it appears that the edmontosaur must have left for at least part of the year and migrated to more temperate zones to find food.
<br><br>
Second, many edmontosaur skeletons have been unearthed from the same site. This suggests that edmontosaurs lived in herd. Many modern-day migratory animals, such as caribou and buffalo, live and migrate in herds as well. Moving in herds helps animals coordinate their migration.The finding that edmonotsaurs lived in herds further supports the migration hypothesis.
<br><br>
Finally, edmonosaurs were physically capable of migrating long distances. To reach more hospitable regions, the edmontosaur had to migrate about 1,600 kilometers southward. To make such a journey, the edmontosaur needed to move at about five kilometers per hour for several weeks, which is certainly could do. These animals could run very fast, reaching speeds up to 45 kilometers per hour. It could have easily used its locomotive power to move to warmer climate during the harsh arctic winters.

As I mentioned in class, technology advancements have a profound impact on society. Governments often face the challenge of determining the allocation of resources between investing in scientific research and promoting social welfare programs. If you were a policy maker, which issue would you argue is more importantâ€”investing in scientific research or promoting social welfare programs? Why?


<br><br>

<strong style = "text-align: center;">Karen</strong><br>

Investing in scientific research should take precedence. Technological advancements drive progress and innovation, benefiting society as a whole. Scientific research leads to breakthroughs, new discoveries, and improved quality of life. Furthermore, advancements in technology can eventually support the development of effective social welfare programs.


<br><br>

I disagree with Karen. Promoting social welfare programs should be the priority. Meeting the immediate needs of individuals in society is crucial for their well-being. By investing in social welfare programs, we address poverty, healthcare, and education, creating a more equitable and inclusive society. Social welfare programs lay the foundation for progress and can provide a supportive environment for scientific research in the long run.
