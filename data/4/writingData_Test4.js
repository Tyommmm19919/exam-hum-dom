        As early as the twelfth century A.D., the settlements of Chaco Canyon in New Mexico in the American Southwest were notable for their “great houses,” massive stone buildings that contain hundreds of rooms and often stand three or four stories high.<br> Archaeologists have been trying to determine how the buildings were used. While there is still no universally agreed upon explanation, there are three competing theories.

One theory holds that the Chaco structures were purely residential, with each housing hundreds of people. Supporters of this theory have interpreted Caco great houses as earlier versions of the architecture seen in more recent Southwest societies. In particular, the Chaco houses appear strikingly similar to the large, well-known “apartment buildings” at Taos, new Mexico, in which many people have been living for centuries.<br>

A second theory contends that the Chaco structures were used to store food supplies. One of the main crops of the Chaco people was grain maize, which could be stored for long periods of time without spoiling and could serve as a long-lasting supply of food. The supplies of maize had to be storedsomewhere, and the size of the great houses would make them very suitable for the purpose. A third theory proposes that houses were used as ceremonial centers. Close to one house, called Pueblo Alto, archaeologists identified an enormous mound formed by a pile of old material. Excavations of the mound revealed deposits containing a surprisingly large number of broken pots. This finding has been interpreted as evidence that people gathered at Pueblo Alto for special ceremonies. At the ceremonies, they ate festive meals and then discarded the pots in which the meals had been prepared or served. Such ceremonies have been documented for other Native American cultures.

        question:`
Doctor Achebe: Let's continue talking about consumer behavior. We have been discussing
different ways people choose what products to buy, and there are many potential sources
of information and advice for consumers. In your opinion, which is the better strategy for
purchasing, relying on advice from friends and family or depending on information from
online sources? Why?
<br><br>
Claire: Asking friends and family members for product recommendations might seem
easier, but getting all the necessary information might take too long. An internet search
would be much more efficient. Many consumer magazines are available online that
compile lots of data to compare the advantages and disadvantages of one product versus
another.
<br><br>
Paul: The last time I bought a computer, I just watched a few videos online to decide, and
now I regret that. My friends could have advised me better because they know my
preferences and the kind of features that I am interested in. Consumers should get advice
from the people around them to find the most suitable products.
