          <p>
           Heating prices, and the university’s heating bills, reached record-high level this year. In an effort to reduce heating costs, the university decides to lower the temperature in classroom buildings on weekends and on workdays after five P.M., when the day’s classes have officially ended. Because class will not be in session at these times, the reduced heat will not have negative impact on students and their studies. The university considers it essential that the cost-saving measures not interfere with student activities.

          <p>
            Many popular and well-known business chains, such as fast food restaurants, use a practice known as franchising. In franchising, someone who wants to open a store or a restaurant pays an established company for the right to use the company’s name and sell the company’s products. Selling an established, in-demand product that has immediate name recognition benefits the new business by reducing the risk that the business will fail. In exchange, the new business agrees to follow all of the standard practices of the company with the name it wants to use.
