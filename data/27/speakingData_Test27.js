          <h1 style="text-align:center;">Keep the Music Building Open Later</h1>
          <p>
           Currently, the campus music building'which has practice rooms students can reserve for playing instruments'closes nightly at nine p.m. I think the university should keep the building open until midnight. Often, student musicians want to practice their instruments later at night, and right now there" s no good place for them to do that. Also, lots of students want to use the practice rooms, so if s often difficult to reserve one. If the building were open more hours,though, it would be easier to accommodate the large number of students who want to reserve rooms.

          <p>
            Sometimes companies realize that consumers may have developed a negative impression of a product. One way in which they can resolve this problem is by using an advertising technique known as refute-and-persuade. Refute-and-persuade means that in advertising a product, the company first indicates its awareness of the product's disadvantage. But then the company refutes or challenges that disadvantage by demonstrating how the advantage of buying and using the product makes up for any limitation it may have. In this way, companies can persuade consumers to purchase a product despite its drawbacks.
