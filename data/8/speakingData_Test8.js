          <p>
           The business studies department at State University will now require all students enrolled in its program to complete one semester of work experience in a local corporation or small business. It is felt that students will benefit from this work experience by developing leadership and organizational skills that would not normally be learned in a classroom or campus setting. Furthermore, the relationship that students establish with the company that they work for may help them to secure permanent employment with that company once they have completed the program and graduated.

          <p>
            Film directors use different types of camera shots for specific purposes. An establishing shot is an image shown briefly at the beginning of a scene, usually taken from far away. That is used to provide context fro the rest of the scene. One purpose of the establishing shot is to communicate back ground information to the viewer, such as setting---where and when the rest of the scene will occur. It also establishes the mood feeling of the scene. Due to the context that the establishing shot provides, the characters and events that are shown next are better understood by the viewer.
