Car manufacturers and governments have been eagerly seeking a replacement for the automobile’s main source of power, the internal-combustion engine. By far the most promising alternative source of energy for cars is the hydrogen-based fuel- cell engine, which uses hydrogen to create electricity that, in turn, powers the car. Fuel-cell engines have several advantages over internal-combustion engines and will probably soon replace them.
<br><br>
One of the main problems with the internal-combustion engine is that it relies on petroleum, either in the form of gasoline or diesel fuel. Petroleum is a finite resource; someday, we will run out of oil. They hydrogen needed for fuel-cell engines cannot easily be depleted. Hydrogen can be derived from various plentiful sources, including natural gas and even water. The fact that fuel-cell engines utilize easily available, renewable resources makes them particularly attractive.
<br><br>
Second, hydrogen-based fuel cells are attractive because they will solve many of the world’s pollution problems. An unavoidable by-product of burning oil is carbon dioxide, and carbon dioxide harms the environment. On the other hand, the only byproduct of fuel-cell engines is water.
<br><br>
Third, fuel-cell engines will soon be economically competitive because people will spend less money to operate a fuel-cell engine than they will to operate an internal-combustion engine. This is true for one simple reason: a fuel- cell automobile is nearly twice as efficient in using its fuel as an automobile powered by an internal-combustion engine is. In other words, the fuel-cell powered car requires only half the fuel energy that the internal- combustion powered car does to go the same distance.

        question:`
Dr Achebe: This week, we'll be discussing the role of public libraries in today's society.
Nowadays, because more people are turning to online reading, fewer and fewer people
are using public libraries. I want you to consider this question: Are public libraries still
useful in today's world? Is it still necessary for the government to continue funding public
libraries now? why?
<br><br>
Andrew: I don't think so because public libraries have become less important in the
modern world. With the vast amount of information available on the Internet, more and
more people read e-books online, and fewer and fewer people visit public libraries. This
makes public libraries almost useless and unnecessary. Take me as an example. These
days, I rarely visit public libraries.
<br><br>
Claire: I believe that the government should continue funding public libraries, as they still
serve a vital purpose in today's society. Public libraries are not only spaces for students to
read books but also offer various beneficial reading programs. For example, by organizing
storybook reading programs for children at a library, we can inspire their interest in reading
and improve their reading skills.
