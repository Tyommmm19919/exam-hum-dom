        Endotherms are animals such as modern birds and mammals that keep their body temperatures constant. For instance, humans are endotherms and maintain an internal temperature of 37℃,no matter whether the environment is warm or cold. Because dinosaurs were reptiles, and modern reptiles are not endotherms, it was long assumed that dinosaurs were not endotherms. However, dinosaurs differ in many ways from modern reptiles, and there is now considerable evidence that dinosaurs were, in fact, endotherms. Polar dinosaurs<br>

One reason for believing that dinosaurs were endotherms is that dinosaur fossils have been discovered in Polar Regions. Only animals that can maintain a temperature well above that of the surrounding environment could be active in such cold climates.<br>

Leg position and movement<br>

There is a connection between endothermy and the position and movement of the legs. The physiology of endothermy allows sustained physical activity, such as running. But running is efficient only if an animal’s legs are positioned underneath its body, not at the body’s side, as they are for crocodiles and many lizards. The legs of all modern endotherms are underneath the body, and so were the legs of dinosaurs. This strongly suggests that dinosaurs were endotherms.<br>

Haversian canals<br>

There is also a connection between endothermy and bone structure. The bones of endotherms usually include structures called Haversian canals. These canals house nerves and blood vessels that allow the living animal to grow quickly, and rapid body growth is in fact a characteristic of endothermy. The presence of Haversian canals in bone is a strong indicator that the animal is an endotherm, and fossilized bones of dinosaurs are usually dense with Haversian canals.

Doctor Achebe: Many companies provide important products and services but cause
environmental damage. Some people believe the way to prevent these companies from
damaging the environment is for the government to require more penalties, such as higher
taxes and more significant fines. Do you think it is a good idea?
<br><br>
Andrew: Many companies make helpful products but hurt the environment, too. To stop
the damage, the government should punish them more by raising taxes and fines. Doing
that would hold corporations accountable and force them to change impactfully. We can
have both innovation and sustainability if governments incentivize it properly through
penalties.
<br><br>
Claire: I can't entirely agree that we should penalize corporations more for environmental
damage. Many companies are already taking steps to adopt greener practices, and higher
taxes or fines could discourage innovation and hurt the economy. Instead of punishing
businesses, the government should reward and incentivize sustainable choices through
subsidies and tax breaks.
