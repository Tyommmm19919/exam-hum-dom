          <h1 style="text-align:center;">Switch to Electronic Textbooks</h1>
          <p>
           The university will begin switching from traditional-bound textbooks early next year. University students will be able to download the content of their required textbooks to a reading device and read the material directly from the device’s screen. While the cost of the device is around $200, it is a one-time expense. Considering the rising cost of textbooks, students will save money in the long run since purchasing electronic books for their classes is much less expensive than buying regular textbooks. Furthermore, the university believes the device will be an effective study aid because it is simple to operate and offers features such as highlighting of text and note-taking.

          <h1 style="text-align:center;">Swarm Intelligence</h1>
          <p>
            Some insect species live in large groups, or “swarms.” Such swarms typically include several thousand individual insects. Living in swarms allows these insects to accomplish complex tasks together through complex behaviors. The behavior of the insects as a group demonstrates a greater level of complexity than the behavior of individual group members. This complex group behavior is called swarm intelligence. With swarm intelligence, each insect performs a simple instinctual behavior that is repeated by other individuals that results in a complex behavior. Insects swarms are able to accomplish tasks that individual insects would not be able to achieve.
