          <h1 style="text-align:center;">College Radio Station to Undergo Major Changes?</h1>
          <p>
            The university is considering making major changes to the college radio station. Changes would include an expansion of the station’s broadcasting range, which would allow the radio’s programming to reach nearby towns. One goal of the plan is to attract more students to apply to its communications program. Another goal is provide the university with an extra source of revenue. University officials expect the enhanced radio station to significantly increase the number of listeners, which will in turn encourage businesses to place commercials on the radio.

          <h1 style="text-align:center;">Subliminal Perception</h1>
          <p>
          Humans are constantly perceiving visual and auditory stimuli. Sometimes our perception of these stimuli occurs consciously: we are aware of a stimulus and know what we are perceiving it. But our perception of a stimulus can also occur without our awareness: an image might appear and disappear before our eyes too quickly for us to notice what we saw it, or a sound might be too faint for us to realize that we heard it. This phenomenon---the perception of a stimulus just below the threshold of conscious awareness---is called subliminal perception. Experiments have shown that subliminally perceived stimuli can influence people’s thoughts and attitudes.
