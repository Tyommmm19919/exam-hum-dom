Jane Austen (1775-1817) is one of the most famous of all English novelists, and today her novels are more popular than ever, with several recently adapted as Hollywood movies. But we do not have many records of what she looked like. For a long time, the only accepted image of Austen was an amateur sketch of an adult Austen made by her sister Cassandra. However recently a professionally painted, full-length portrait of a teenage girl owned by a member of the Austen family has come up for sale. Although the professional painting is not titled Jane Austen, there are good reasons to believe she is the subject.
<br><br>First, in 1882, several decades after Austen's death, Austen's family gave permission to use the portrait as an illustration in an edition of her letters. Austen's family clearly recognized it as a portrait of the author. So, for over a century now, the Austen family itself has endorsed the claim that the girl in the portrait is Jane Austen.
<br><br>Second, the face in the portrait clearly resembles the one in Cassandra's sketch, which we know depicts Austen. Though somewhat amateurish, the sketch communicates definite details about Austen's face. Even though the Cassandra sketch is of an adult Jane Austen, the features are still similar to those of the teenage girl in the painting. The eyebrows, nose, mouth, and overall shape of the face are very much like those in the full-length portrait.
<br><br>Third, although the painting is unsigned and undated, there is evidence that it was painted when Austen was a teenager. The style links it to Ozias Humphrey, a society portrait painter who was the kind of professional the wealthy Austen family would hire. Humphrey was active in the late 1780s and early 1790s, exactly the period when Jane Austen was the age of the girl in the painting.

Doctor Achebe: Let's continue talking about consumer behavior. We have been discussing
different ways people choose what products to buy, and there are many potential sources
of information and advice for consumers. In your opinion, which is the better strategy for
purchasing, relying on advice from friends and family or depending on information from
online sources? Why?
<br><br>
Claire: Asking friends and family members for product recommendations might seem
easier, but getting all the necessary information might take too long. An internet search
would be much more efficient. Many consumer magazines are available online that
compile lots of data to compare the advantages and disadvantages of one product versus
another.
<br><br>
Paul: The last time I bought a computer, I just watched a few videos online to decide, and
now I regret that. My friends could have advised me better because they know my
preferences and the kind of features that I am interested in. Consumers should get advice
from the people around them to find the most suitable products.
