          <p>
           The university will now send all students a daily email containing information about campus events and activities. Rather than get information about campus events once a week in the campus newspaper, students will get the information every day, thus ensuring that it is always up-to-date. According to the university spokesman who announced the plan, “For all of us now, e-mail is part of our daily lives”. Students in particular have become used to relying on email and the Internet for most communication, so it is a logical change that will benefit everyone.

          <h1 style="text-align:center;">Questioning Awareness of Effect</h1>
          <p>
            When a student engages in disruptive behavior in the classroom, it negatively impacts on both the teacher’s ability to teach and other students’ ability to learn. One way a teacher can correct disruptive behavior is by questioning awareness of effect. With this technique, when a student disrupts the class, the teacher asks a question that draws attention to the negative effect of the student’s behavior. The teacher then does not wait for an answer, but immediately continues teaching. By thus simply drawing attention to the effect of the student’s behavior, the teacher can often lead the student to discontinue the behavior.
