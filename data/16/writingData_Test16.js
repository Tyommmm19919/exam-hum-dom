In the past century, the steady growth of the human population and the corresponding increase in agriculture and pesticide use have caused much harm to wildlife in the United States, birds in particular. Unfortunately for birds, these trends are likely to continue, with the result that the number of birds in the United States will necessarily decline.
<br><br>
First, as human populations and settlements continue to expand, birdsâ€™ natural habitats will continue to disappear. Forests, wetlands, and grasslands will give way to ever more homes, mails, and offices. As the traditional areas suitable for birds keep decreasing,so will the size of the bird populations that depend on those vanishing habitats
<br><br>
Second, agricultural activities must increase to keep pace with the growing human population. The growth of agriculture will also result in the further destruction of bird habitats as more and more wilderness areas are converted to agricultural use. As a result, bird populations in rural areas will continue to decline.
<br><br>
Third, as human settlements expand and agriculture increases, the use of chemical pesticides will also increase. Pesticides are poisons designed to kill agricultural and home garden pests, such as insects, but inevitably, pesticides get into the water and into the food chain for birds where they can harm birds. Birds that eat the poisoned insects or drink contaminated water can die as a result, and even if pesticides do not kill birds outright, they can prevent them from reproducing successfully. So pesticides have significantly contributed to declines in bird population, and because there will continue to be a need to control agricultural pests in the future, this decline will continue.

Dr Achebe: This week, we'll examine issues in education reform. For example, some
educators think that by focusing mainly on foundational knowledge in subjects like
reading, math, and science, schools are not fully preparing students for success in the
workplace. These educators argue that soft skills- nonacademic skills such as being
empathetic or having a strong work ethic should be part of the curriculum, with classroom
time dedicated to developing these skills. Do you agree? Why or why not?
<br><br>

Andrew: I don't think so because public libraries have become less important in the
modern world. With the vast amount of information available on the Internet, more and
more people read e-books online, and fewer and fewer people visit public libraries. This
makes public libraries almost useless. Take me as an example. These days, I rarely visit
public libraries.
<br><br>

Claire: I agree. While students need a strong foundation in academic subjects, soft skills
are important because they affect how well students do their work. If classroom time is set
aside for these skills, students will take them seriously, and their academic work will
benefit. Teachers could design lessons so that students learn about a skill and then do
role-playing activities with classmates.
