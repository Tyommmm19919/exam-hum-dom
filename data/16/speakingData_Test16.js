          <p>
           Say good-bye to the big, multiperson study tables in Turner Library. This summer, the tables will be exchanged for new personal study cubicles---small, one-person desks enclosed by walls. These new units will allow students to have privacy and work in isolation and will therefore eliminate noise in the library so students can concentrate. Additionally, the cubicles will enable the library to accommodate the recent increase in the number of students attending our university. Although the current tables seat six students each, they make poor use of the available floor space. The cubicles, on the other hand, are designed for maximum space efficiency, and the library can therefore add 50 new seats.

          <h1 style="text-align:center;">Ritualization</h1>
          <p>
            Sociobiologists believe that some communicative behavior in animals is developed through a process called ritualization. In this process, the purpose of a give behavior changes over time---a behavior that originally had a practical purpose develops into one that communicates a specific message. For example, a certain movement or physical feature might evolve to serve as a signal or a warning that other animals will understand. Once a behavior is ritualized, it becomes a form of communication; therefore, if an animal engages in this behavior, other animals will be able to interpret the meaning of the behavior quickly and respond appropriately
