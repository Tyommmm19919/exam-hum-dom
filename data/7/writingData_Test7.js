Toward the end of his life, the Chevalier de Seingalt (1725-1798) wrote a long memoir recounting his life and adventures the Chevalier was a somewhat controversial figure, but since he met many famous people,including kings and writers, his memoir has become a valuable historical source about European society in the eighteenth century. However, some critics have raised doubts about the accuracy of the memoir. They claim that the Chevalier distorted or invented many events in the memoir to make his life seem more exciting and glamorous that it really was.
<br><br>For example, in his memoir the Chevalier claims that while living in Switzerland, he was very wealthy, and it is known that he spent a great deal of money there on parties and gambling. However, evidence has recently surfaced that the Chevalier borrowed considerable sums of money from a Swiss merchant. Critics thus argue that if the Chevalier had really been very rich, he would not have needed to borrow money.
<br><br>Critics are also skeptical about the accuracy of the conversations that the Chevalier records in the memoir between himself and the famous writer Voltaire. No one doubts that the Chevalier and Voltaire met and conversed. However, critics complain that the memoir cannot possibly capture these conversations accurately, because it was written many years after the conversations occurred. Critics point out that it is impossible to remember exact phrases from extended conversations held many years earlier. 
<br><br>Critics have also questioned the memoir’s account of the Chevalier’s escape from a notorious prison in Venice, Italy. He claims to have escaped the Venetian prison by using a piece of metal to make a hole in the ceiling and climbing through the roof.
<br><br>Critics claim that while such a daring escape makes for enjoyable reading, it is more likely that the Chevaliers jailers were bribed to free him. They point out that the Chevalier had a number of politically well-connected friends in Venice who could have offered a bribe.

        question:`
Doctor: This week, we'll discuss ways to address air pollution. One idea is introducing
environmental taxes on air travel. Such taxes, also called ecological or green taxes, are
extra charges added to the price of airplane tickets. Money collected from these taxes
could be invested in environmentally friendly technologies or in promoting other cleaner
modes of transportation. Do you think there should be an environmental tax on air travel?
Why or why not? <br><br>
Andrew: We should impose environmental taxes on air travel. These taxes might
encourage people to find cheaper, more eco-friendly ways to get places. In my country,
many people use planes to fly short distances because flights are relatively inexpensive
when they could just as quickly take a less polluting form of transportation.<br><br>
Claire: Additional taxes on air travel will do little to solve the air pollution problem. Airplane
tickets would become more expensive, punishing passengers without incentivizing airlines
to become more environmentally friendly. The airlines should pay the price to protect the
environment, not their customers.
