The sea otter is a small mammal that lives in waters along the western coast of North America from California to Alaska. When some sea otter populations off the Alaskan coast started rapidly declining a few years ago, it caused much concern because see otters play an important ecological role in the coastal ecosystem. Experts started investigating the cause of the decline and quickly realized that there were two possible explanations: environmental pollution or attacks by predators. Initially, the pollution hypothesis seemed the more likely of the two.
<br><br>
The first reason why pollution seemed the more likely cause was that there were known sources of it along the Alaskan coast, such as oil rigs and other sources of industrial chemical pollution. Water samples from the area revealed increased levels of chemicals that could decrease the ottersâ€™ resistance to life-threatening infections and thus could indirectly cause their deaths.
<br><br>
Second, other sea mammals such as seals and sea lions along the Alaskan coast were also declining, indicating that whatever had endangered the otters was affecting other sea mammals as well. This is fact again pointed to environmental pollution, since itusually affects the entire ecosystem rather than a single species. Only widely occurring predators, such as the orca (a large predatory whale), could have the same effect, but orcas prefer to hunt much larger prey, such as other whales.
<br><br>
Third, scientists believed that the pollution hypothesis could also explain the uneven pattern of otter decline: at some Alaskan locations the otter populations declined greatly, while at others they remained stable. Some experts explained these observations by suggesting that ocean currents or other environmental factors may have created uneven concentrations of pollutants along the coast.

Doctor: Some argue that factories, as major producers of pollution and waste, should be
pushed to make dramatic changes in how they operate to protect and preserve the
environment. Others contend that individuals' small, cumulative actions have the greatest
impact, so public awareness and altered societal norms are critical. I would like you to
consider: who should make more efforts regarding environmental protection - factories or
individuals?
<br><br>
Andrew: Factories should take the lead on protecting the environment because their
impact is massive compared to individuals. For example, a single factory can generate
tons of pollution daily, dwarfing what one person produces in a lifetime. Strict regulations
and greener technologies for manufacturers would lead to huge reductions in emissions
and waste.
<br><br>
Claire: Individuals should lead on environmental protection because we can drive cultural
change. By making green lifestyle choices - reducing energy, taking public transit,
minimizing waste - we set an example and normalize sustainability. And by purchasing
eco-products and ethical companies, everyday consumer decisions incentivize businesses
to follow suit.
