          <h1 style="text-align:center;">Campus Construction Should Happen During the Summer</h1>
          <p>
I've noticed that small construction projects on campus'like fixing sidewalks and parking lots'often take place during the regular school year, when classed are in session. I propose that whenever possible the university should schedule such construction projects to take place during the three-month summer break. One reason is that construction projects can be so disruptive; they create inconveniences and can make it hard to get where you need to go on campus. And, second, construction projects would be more likely to be completed quickly if they were scheduled for the summer when the weather is usually good.

          <p>
            We often think of human intelligence as the mental ability to analyze and understand complex ideas. However, many psychologists believe that there is a different type of intelligence called emotional intelligence. People with emotional intelligence have the ability to recognize their true feelings and understand what is causing them. This ability to understand their own feelings enables them to better control their emotional responses,changing or correcting them when necessary. Emotional intelligence helps people to behave appropriately in social situations, which allows them to maintain good relationships with others.
