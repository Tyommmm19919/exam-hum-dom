          <h1 style="text-align:center;">Advisor Meetings Should No Longer Be Required</h1>
          <p>
           At present, students are required to meet with their academic advisors before the beginning of every semester. The advisors help students select courses and advise them on graduation requirements. However, I don’t see the point of required meetings, since the necessary information about the courses is already available on the university’s Web site, which all students have access to. In addition, eliminating meetings with advisors would ease the difficulty that students often have in finding a time to schedule a meeting when both they and their advisors are free.

          <h1 style="text-align:center;">Epiphytes</h1>
          <p>
            In rain forests, the canopy produced by the upper layer of branches may be so dense that few plants can grow on the shady ground below. Even so, many plants have adapted to life in the rain forest, developing fascinating strategies for survival. For example, various species known as epiphytes use a host plant as a platform for growth. Although epiphytes grow on a host tree, they take no nutrients from the tree itself. Attached to the tree, sometimes 30 or 40 meters high, these aerial plants have access to sunlight but not to nutrients from the soil below. As a result, they have developed unusual mechanisms that have allowed them to overcome this problem.
