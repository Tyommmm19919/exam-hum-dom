The cane toad is a large (1.8kg) amphibian species native to Central and South America. It was deliberately introduced to Australia in 1935 with the expectation that it would protect farmersâ€™ crops by eating harmful insects. Unfortunately, the toad multiplied rapidly, and a large cane toad population now threatens small native animals that are not pests. Several measures have been proposed to stop the spread of the cane toad in Australia.
<br><br>
One way to prevent the spread of the load would be to build a national fence. A fence that blocks the advance of the toads will prevent them from moving into those parts of Australia that they have not yet colonized. This approach has been used before: a national fence was erected in the early part of the twentieth century to prevent the spread of rabbits, another animal species that was introduced in Australia from abroad and had a harmful impact on its native ecosystems.
<br><br>
Second, the toads could be captured and destroyed by volunteers. Cane toads can easily be caught in simple traps and can even be captured by hand. Young toads and cane toad eggs are even easier to gather and destroy, since they are restricted to the water. If the Australian government were to organize a campaign among Australian citizens to join forces to destroy the toads, the collective effort might stop the toad from spreading.
<br><br>
Third, researchers are developing a disease-causing virus to control the cane toad populations. This virus will be specially designed: although it will be able to infect a number of reptile and amphibian species, it will not harm most of the infected species; it will specially harm only the cane toads. The virus will control the population of cane toads by preventing them from maturing and reproducing

        question: `

Professor: When it comes to groceries, everyone has their preferred shopping destination.Some prefer the convenience and variety of supermarkets, while others enjoy small
grocery stores' personal touch and community connection. Which do you like? Why?
<br><br>

Shopper 1: As a frequent shopper, I prefer supermarkets because of their more
comprehensive selection of products, lower prices, and greater convenience.
Supermarkets offer a one-stop shopping experience where shoppers can buy everything
they need for their weekly meal planning. In addition, supermarkets have longer opening
hours than small grocery stores, allowing for more flexibility to shop based on personal
schedules.


<br><br>

Shopper 2: Small retailers usually cater to a niche market and carry a limited range of
products. Small shops know their customers and tend to develop a rapport with them over
time. This feeling of a connection to the store leads to repeat business. A small store
requires a smaller square footage and can be close to a residential area, offering
customers convenience and accessibility for quick shopping trips. Fulfilling customers'
needs by taking special orders and bringing in unique products is one way to make the
small shop a go-to place for customers looking for something specific.
