            <h1 style="text-align:center;">University Should Pave Running Trails</h1>
            <p>
  The university has about three miles of unpaved dirt running trails that pass through the forest near campus. I think these trails should be paved with cement. One reason for paving the trails would be to increase their safety. When it rains, the dirt turns to mud and becomes very slippery, so the runners who use them can slip and fall. Pavement would solve this problem. Also, paving would make the trails look nicer, which would encourage students to use them. Bumps in the trial would be smoothed out and weeds would be paved over, making the trail more attractive to runners.

            <h1 style="text-align:center;">Experiment Effect</h1>
            <p>
              One objective of any experiment is, of course, to obtain accurate results. Sometimes, however, problems occur that lead to inaccurate results. One such problem is the experimenter effect. The experimenter effect occurs when a researcher’s expectations affect the outcome of the experiment. The researcher expects a particular result from the experiment, and expectation causes the researcher to act in ways that influence the behavior of the experiment participants, thereby invalidating the result of the experiment.
