          <p>
           Over the last ten years, the number of Central College students living on campus in dormitories has decreased by twenty percent. In an effort to counteract the trend, the college has announced a plan to renovate its on-campus housing. The renovations will take two years, and they will include improvements to the bathrooms, lighting, and heating in the dormitories. “A lot of people are moving off campus because the dorms aren’t in great shape,” explained the college president. “By renovating the dorms, we can make them more appealing than off-campus housing, and more students will choose to remain on campus.”

          <p>
            Outsider Art is a term used to describe art that is made by people who choose to live and work outside society. The artists who produce this kind of art-Outsider Artists- work in isolation from other artists and have little or no formal artistic training. Because they do not learn conventional artistic techniques from teachers or other artists, outsider artists must invent their own ways of doing things. As a result of the unconventional methods that outsider artists often use, their work can look strange and not at all like traditional art to the observer.
