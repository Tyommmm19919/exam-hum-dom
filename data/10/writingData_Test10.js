A recent study reveals that people especially young people are reading far less literature,novels, plays, and poems, than they used to. This is troubling because the trend has unfortunate effects for the reading public, for culture in general, and for the future of literature itself.
<br><br>
While there has been a decline in book reading generally, the decline has been especially sharp for literature. This is unfortunate because nothing else provides the intellectual stimulation that literature does. Literature encourages us to exercise our imaginations, empathize with others, and expand our understanding of language. So by reading less literature, the reading public is missing out on important benefits.
<br><br>
Unfortunately, missing out on the benefits of literature is not the only problem. What are people reading instead? Consider the prevalence of self-help books on lists of best sellers. These are usually superficial poorly written, and intellectually undemanding. Additionally, instead of sitting down with a challenging novel, many persons are now more likely to turn on the television, watch a music video, or read a Web page. Clearly, diverting time previously spent in reading literature to trivial forms of entertainment has lowered the level of culture in general.

        question: `
Doctor: Some argue that factories, as major producers of pollution and waste, should be
pushed to make dramatic changes in how they operate to protect and preserve the
environment. Others contend that individuals' small, cumulative actions have the greatest
impact, so public awareness and altered societal norms are critical. I would like you to
consider: who should make more efforts regarding environmental protection - factories or
individuals?
<br><br>
Andrew: Factories should take the lead on protecting the environment because their
impact is massive compared to individuals. For example, a single factory can generate
tons of pollution daily, dwarfing what one person produces in a lifetime. Strict regulations
and greener technologies for manufacturers would lead to huge reductions in emissions
and waste.
<br><br>
Claire: Individuals should lead on environmental protection because we can drive cultural
change. By making green lifestyle choices - reducing energy, taking public transit,
minimizing waste - we set an example and normalize sustainability. And by purchasing
eco-products and ethical companies, everyday consumer decisions incentivize businesses
to follow suit.
