Private collectors have been selling and buying fossils, the petrified remains of ancient organisms, ever since the eighteenth century. In recent years, however, the sale of fossils, particularly of dinosaurs and other large vertebrates, has grown into a big business. Rare and important fossils are now being sold to private ownership for millions of dollars. This is an unfortunate development for both scientists and the general public.
<br><br>
The public suffers because fossils that would otherwise be donated to museums where everyone can see them are sold to private collectors who do not allow the public to view their collections. Making it harder for the public to see fossils can lead to a decline in public interest in fossils, which would be a pity.
<br><br>
More importantly, scientists are likely to lose access to some of the most important fossils and thereby miss out on potentially crucial discoveries about extinct life forms. Wealthy fossil buyers with a desire to own the rarest and most important fossils can spend virtually limitless amounts of money to acquire them. Scientists and the museums and universities they work for often cannot compete successfully for fossils against millionaire fossil buyers.

        question: `
Doctor: This week's course materials will focus on scientific discoveries. While scientific
researchers usually prefer to share what they learn with other scientists, many businesses
and governments keep certain scientific discoveries secret. Some people believe that all
scientific discoveries should be shared freely among scientists worldwide and that
governments and companies should not hold any discoveries secret. What do you think
and why?

<br><br>

Kelly: I don't think all discoveries should be shared. Businesses. for example, often
spend a lot of money on scientific research to make a discovery that can lead to profit.
Even if that discovery benefits everyone, the business has a right to keep the discovery
secret to develop a profitable product from the research.

<br><br>

Paul: Sharing knowledge is crucially important to most scientists. Scientists usually publish
the details of their discoveries in scientific journals, which means that everyone can see
what the scientists have accomplished. Being recognized as the person who made a
discovery is the biggest reward for any scientist. When scientists keep their discoveries
secret, they lose that recognition. That is very unsatisfying.
