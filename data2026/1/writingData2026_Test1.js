Volunteerism refers to the act of offering your time and service without financial compensation to benefit a community, organization, or cause. While many people volunteer mainly to help others, some institutions have mandatory volunteer programs. High schools are one example, where students may be required to complete a certain number of volunteer hours to graduate. What do you think? Should high school students be required to do volunteer work? Why or why not?

<br><br>

Yes, I think high schools should require volunteer hours because it helps students build a sense of civic responsibility. Many teenagers don’t naturally think about helping others, and this requirement can introduce them to the idea that their time and effort can make a real difference in the lives of others.

<br><br>

I don’t think volunteer hours should be required because many students already have limited free time. Some have part-time jobs or take care of younger siblings after school. Adding a mandatory volunteer requirement could create extra stress and make it harder for those students to balance their existing responsibilities.
